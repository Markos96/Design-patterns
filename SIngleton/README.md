# Strategy Pattern

---

### Description

This example project implements the **Strategy** design pattern in Java to manage different payment methods, such as MercadoPago, PayPal and Prisma. The Strategy pattern allows us to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each of them and make them interchangeable. This facilitates extensibility and adaptability to different payment situations without modifying the existing code.
